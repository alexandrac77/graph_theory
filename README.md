ATU: summer assessment 21/22
Alexandra Cotter (G00385851)


The purpose of this repository is for my Summer assessment in Graph Theory. It contains two Jupyter notebooks which cover the topics of the Heap Sort algorithm and the Graph Isomorphism problem.

Within the Heap Sort notebook the following content is discussed:
• Explanation of the Heap Sort algorithm.
• Python function implementing Heap Sort.
• Explanation of the computational complexity of Heap Sort.
• Explanation of how graph theory is used in Heap Sort.

Within the Graph Isomorphism notebook the following content is discussed:
• Explanation of the Graph Iomorphism Problem.
• Explanation of how graphs can be represented in data structures.
• Python function implementing an algorithm to determine if two graphs are isomorphic or not.
• Discussion of the computational complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.

To view the notebooks:
1. Download the latest version of Anaconda for Python.
2. Install Anaconda by following the instructions on the download page and/or in the executable.
3. Clone this repository. 
4. Run the following command in a terminal: jupyter-notebook.
The jupyter notebook will be launched, providing access to both notebooks.
